- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the term "bug" to describe a glitch or error in a computer program originated in 1947 when a moth got trapped in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer? This incident was documented by computer scientist Grace Hopper, who coined the term "debugging" to describe the process of fixing computer glitches.
